========================
Most Played Games on BGG
========================

This project computes a ranking of the most played board games on Board Game Geek.

Explanations: https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/272430/most-played-games-all-time-updated-april-2020 .

In addition to the packages used here (numpy, pandas, selenium), you also need a chrome driver, which can be found
here: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/downloads . Put it in the same directory as this project.

To launch the whole code, execute ``main.py``. Ultimately, it creates the file ``geeklist.txt``.
